MENU:
FIELDS: UserName Password
BUTTONS: CreateAccount Login Close
LINKS_TO: HOMEPAGE

The MENU page is a simple login page that sends login requests to a server to
verify USERNAME/PASSWORD combinations.  On a positive response the webpage is
forwarded to the HOMEPAGE.

If the person accessing the page for the first time is new, the button CREATE
ACCOUNT will submit a request to the server to see if the USERNAME is unique.
On a positive response the page refreshes and alters the user that the account
was created.

USERNAME is a simple ASCII string from 1 to 20 characters in length with no
spaces or special characters.

PASSWORD is a simple ASCII string from 5 to 20 characters in length with any
combination of standard letters or numbers.
